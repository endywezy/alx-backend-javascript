Unit and Integration Testing in JavaScript
Project Overview
This project demonstrates unit and integration testing in JavaScript using various tools such as Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. It includes testing different functions and APIs to ensure their correctness and reliability.

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 10.14.x)
npm (Node Package Manager)
Setup
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/alx-backend-javascript.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd alx-backend-javascript/0x06-unittests_in_js
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
npm install
File Structure
0-calcul.js: Simple function that rounds and sums two numbers.
0-calcul.test.js: Mocha test cases for 0-calcul.js.
1-calcul.js: Extended function with additional operations (SUM, SUBTRACT, DIVIDE).
1-calcul.test.js: Test cases for 1-calcul.js.
2-calcul_chai.js: Copy of 1-calcul.js using Chai for assertions.
2-calcul_chai.test.js: Test cases for 2-calcul_chai.js.
3-payment.js: Uses a helper function from utils.js for calculations.
3-payment.test.js: Tests using Sinon spies to verify function calls.
4-payment.js: Stubbed version of 3-payment.js to avoid calling actual functions.
4-payment.test.js: Tests using Sinon stubs and spies.
5-payment.js: Same as 4-payment.js.
5-payment.test.js: Tests using hooks (beforeEach and afterEach).
6-payment_token.js: Async function returning a promise.
6-payment_token.test.js: Test cases for async function using done.
7-skip.test.js: Demonstrates skipping failing tests.
8-api: Integration tests for an Express API.
9-api: Additional integration tests with parameter validation.
10-api: Final integration tests with more complex endpoints.
Running the Tests
Run specific test files using:
bash
Copy code
npm test <test-file-name>
Example:
bash
Copy code
npm test 0-calcul.test.js
To run all tests in a directory:
bash
Copy code
npm test
Tools and Libraries
Mocha: JavaScript test framework running on Node.js.
Chai: Assertion library for behavior-driven testing.
Sinon: Spy, stub, and mock library to control and test function behaviors.
Express: Web framework for Node.js used in integration testing.
Test Cases and Coverage
Unit Tests: Verify the functionality and edge cases of individual functions.
Integration Tests: Test the API endpoints for correct responses and error handling.
Tips and Best Practices
Always ensure each test case is independent.
Use stubs and spies to isolate functions and avoid external dependencies.
Handle asynchronous tests carefully using done or returning promises.
Skip tests when debugging to focus on specific issues without removing them.
Additional Information
Refer to the specific files for detailed function implementations and test cases. Modify and extend test cases as needed to cover additional edge cases and scenarios.
